# Ant-Colony-Optimization-for-Delivery

## Explanation:
The ant colony optimization algorithm (ACO) is a probabilistic technique for solving computational problems which can be reduced to finding good paths through graphs. Artificial ants stand for multi-agent methods inspired by the behavior of real ants. The pheromone-based communication of biological ants is often the predominant paradigm used.

## Input Format:
Each line except first one contains x and y coordinates of the house location. The first line represents the coordinates of the source where the delivery will start.
Format : xcord, ycord

## Programming Language
Java is used as the programming language
